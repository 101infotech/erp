### Data Flow
```
Component
    ↓
Custom Hook (useLeads, useAnalytics, etc.)
    ↓
API Service Layer (leadsApi.js functions)
    ↓
API Configuration (auth, headers, error handling)
    ↓
Backend API (Phase 2 Endpoints)
    ↓
Database (Phase 1 Models)
```

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
// Each component uses custom hooks
const { data, loading, error, methods } = useCustomHook()

// Hooks handle API calls and state
// Components focus on UI/presentation
// Props for parent-child communication
```
